            <h2>Project Description :</h2>
            <h3 class="one">This project utilizes many technologies and languages. The tech used is -> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, NodeJS with ExpressJS, Python 3.9, JSONs, Scikit library, etc. The machine used is MacBook Pro(Intel) with macOS Monterey 12.2.1. Coding was done in VSCode and IDLE3.9. Apart from all the files in "Project Neutrino" folder another folder HModel.joblib is used which contains the neutral network model which makes the prediction. The neutal network has 784 input nodes, 2 layers of hidden nodes with 500 nodes each and 10 output nodes. It took almost 3 minutes to train the neural network. It was trained with the MNIST database (Check online). The accuracy reported was almost 97%. Now, instructions to use are given. First, we have to draw a number on the board on the left. To do this we have to double click and drag the cursor to the required shape. On leaving the click the, the brush would have disengaged. However, sometimes due to sensitivity issues the brush does not disengage even on leaving the click. In this case, do not panic and double click on the board again slowly. The brush will disengage now. Each square represents one pixel which will be coloured based on its nearness to the cursor. If you are not satisfied by your drawing click "Draw Again" button to erase your drawing. Click "Recognise" button so that JavaScript would send the pixel data to a NodeJS server which is listening at "http://localhost/3000". The JavaScript would send a HTTP POST request to NodeJS. NodeJS would receive the pixel data sent. NodeJS would send the data to a Python script by command line arguments. Python would send the data to the HModel which would give back a prediction. Python's standard output is collected by NodeJS which sends the HTTPS RESPONSE back to JavaScript. JavaScript then updates the Guess number. This process takes an appreciable time (in milliseconds). Hence, time latency is also shown for the entire process. Rest of the parts of this project is self explanatory. This entire flow of information involved a lot of JSONs, Strings, Objects making it non structured. It was felt that, there should be a proper universal system to transfer information w</h3>
